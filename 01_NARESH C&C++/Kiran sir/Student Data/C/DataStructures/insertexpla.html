<strong>Explanation with an example</strong><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the simplest sorting algorithms is the Insertion sort. It consists of n-1 	passes. For pass p=2 through n, insertion sort ensures that the elements in position 	1 through p are in sorted order. It makes use of the fact that elements in positions 	1 through p-1 are already known to be in sorted order.<br>
     <strong>Example:</strong><br>
	<table>
	<TR><TD>Original</TD>
	<td>34</td>
	<td>8</td>
	<td>64</td>
	<td>51</td>
	<td>32</td>
	<td>21</td>
	<td>positions moved</td>
	</TR>
	
	<TR><TD>Afterp=2</TD>
	<td>8</td>
	<td>34</td>
	<td>64</td>
	<td>51</td>
	<td>32</td>
	<td>21</td>
	<td>1</td>
	</TR>
	
	<TR><TD>After p=3</TD><td>8</td>
	<td>34</td>
	<td>64</td>
	<td>51</td>
	<td>32</td>
	<td>21</td>
	<td>0</td>
	</TR>
	
	<TR><TD>After p=4</TD> 
	<td>8</td>
	<td>34</td>
	<td>64</td>
	<td>51</td>
	<td>32</td>
	<td>21</td>
	<td>1</td>
	</TR>
	
	<TR><TD>After p=5</TD> 
	<td>8</td>
	<td>32</td>
	<td>34</td>
	<td>51</td>
	<td>64</td>
	<td>21</td>
	<td>3</td>
	</TR>
	
	<TR><TD>After p=2</TD> 
	<td>8</td><td>21</td>
	<td>32</td>
	<td>34</td>
	<td>51</td>
	<td>64</td>
	<td>4</td>
	</TR>
	</table>
		In pass p, we move the pth element left until its correct place is found 	among the first p elements.
