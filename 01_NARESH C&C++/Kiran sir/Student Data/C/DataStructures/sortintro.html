<strong>Introduction:</strong> 

    Sorting is one of the most important operations performed by 
computers. Sorting a set of values - arranging them in a fixed order,
usually alphabetical or numerical is one of the common computing 
applications. The process of getting elements into order is called 
Sorting. Sorting is a good example to perform a task according to
many different algorithms each one having certain advantages and 
disadvantages that have to be weighed against each other in the light
of the particular application. Ideally,one uses different algorithms
depending on whether one is sorting a small set or a large one,on 
whether the individual elements of the set occupy a lot of storage,
on how easy it is to compare two elements to figure out which one 
should precede the other,and so on. That means different applications
require different sorting methods. The degree of order in the input
data also influences the performance of sorting methods.

   Sorting is generally understood to be the process of rearranging
a given set of objects in a specific order. The purpose of sorting 
is to facilitate the later search for members of the sorted set.
As such it is an almost universally performed, fundamental activity.
Objects are sorted in telephone books,in income tax files, in tables
of contents,in libraries, in dictionaries,in warehouses,and almost 
everywhere that sorted objects have to be searched and retrieved.

   Hence,sorting is a relevant and essential activity,particularly 
in data processing. What else would be easier to sort than data!
Nevertheless, our primary interest in sorting is devoted to the even
more fundamental techniques used in the construction of algorithms.
In particular sorting is an ideal subject to demonstrate a great
diversity of algorithms, all having the same purpose, many of them 
being optimal in some sense,and most of them having advantages over
others. It is therefore to demonstrate the necessity of performance 
analysis of algorithms. The example of sorting is moreover well 
suited for showing how a very significant gain in performance may 
be obtained by the development of sophisticated algorithms when 
obvious methods are readily available.

    The dependence of choice of an algorithm on the structure of 
the data to be processed is so profound in the case of sorting that
sorting methods are generally classified into two categories,namely,
sorting of arrays and sorting of (sequential) files. The two classes
are often called internal and external sorting because arrays are 
sorted in the fast, high-speed,random-access "internal" store of 
computers and files are appropriate on the slower,but more spacious
"external" stores based on mechanically moving devices (disks and 
tapes). The importance of this distinction is obvious from the 
example of sorting numbered cards. Structuring the cards of an array
corresponds to laying them out in front of the sorter so that each
card is visible and individually accessible. Structuring the cards
as a file, however, implies that from each file only the card on the 
top is visible. Such a restriction will evidently have serious 
consequences on the sorting method to be used, but it is unavoidable 
if the number of cards to be laid out is larger than the available table.

    Sorting algorithms can be computationally expensive, particularly
as data sets become large. They can be classified into simple algorithms
and sophisticated algorithms. To sort n data elements, simple techniques 
require the order of n2 (O(n2)) comparisons where as sophisticated 
techniques require O(n logn) comparisons. In general, sorting methods 
involves the exchange of elements and moving a portion of data. For a
large data elements set,these operations requires considerable amount
of processing time. Thus, one of the main objective of designing sorting 
algorithms is to minimize exchanges or movement of data.
