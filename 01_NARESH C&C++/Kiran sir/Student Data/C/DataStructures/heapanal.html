Addition and deletion are both O(log n) operations. We need to perform n additions for building a heap, and thus it takes O(n log n) time. Restoring the heap n times takes O(n logn) time. <br>
	Hence the total time complexity is 2* O(n log------- n)= O(n log n)<br>
		The Average, best and worst case performances are O(nlogn)  as there is no best or worst for heap sort algorithm.<br>
		The Heap sort can be used for small or large lists of items. Unlike the Quick sort , it does not degenerate to O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithm. When the list is sorted. Although it has the same time complexity as the quick sort it does not have a few more comparisions, therefore it is a little slower. But when the list is already sorted Heap sort is faster than Quick sort.</body></html>
