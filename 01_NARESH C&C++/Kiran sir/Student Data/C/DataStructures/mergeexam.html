<body>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Example of how the merge routine works is provided for the following input.<br>
<img src="merge1.jpg"><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the array a contains 1,13,24,26 and b contains 2,15,27,38 then the algorithm proceeds as follows: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a comparison is done between 1 and 2. 1 is added to c and then &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13 and 2 are compared.<br>
<img src="merge2.jpg"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 is added to c and then 13 and 15 are compared.<br>
<img src="merge3.jpg"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13 is added to c and then 24 and 15 are compared. This proceeds until 26 and 27 are compared.<br>
<img src="merge4.jpg"><br>
<img src="merge5.jpg"><br>
<img src="merge6.jpg"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26 is added to c and the array a is exhausted.<br>
<img src="merge7.jpg"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remainder of the b array is then copied to c.
<img src="merge8.jpg"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time to merge two sorted list is clearly linear, because at most n-1 comparisons are made , where n is the total number of elements. To see this, note that every comparison adds an element to c except the last which adds atleast two.
