&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A binary tree is a tree in which each node has atmost two children ,a left child and right child .Thus the order of binary tree is 2.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Binary tree is either empty or consists of <br>
(a)a node (called the root node) and<br>	  (b) left and rightsub trees.<br>
Both the subtrees are themselves are binary trees.<br>		  <img src="binary.jpg"><br>
		  In the fig 4.3,node ais the root and also parent of the nodes B and C.Nodes D,F,H,I and j are leaves.<br>
		  Interchanging the right and left subtrees results a new and different tree.That is binary tree is not symmetric tree structures.If two binary trees have same structure then they are said to be similar structure.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Binary trees structures are very useful in processing airthemetic expressions. and is used to evaluate the arithemetic expression.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the following expression;<br>
		(A+B)-(C/(D*E))<br>
		If we traversal the tree in aparticular order we will get one of the basic three forms.
