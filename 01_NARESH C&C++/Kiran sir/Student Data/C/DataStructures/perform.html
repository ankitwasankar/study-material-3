<strong>Performance Analysis:</strong> 
 
Criteria upon which can judge an algorithm includes.
1.Does it do what we want it to do
2.Does it work correctly according to the original specifications
of the task?
3.Is there documentation that describes how to use it and how it 
works?
4.Are procedures created in such a way that they perform logical 
sub functions?
5.Is the code readable?
     These are other criteria for judging algorithms that have a
more direct relationship to performance. These have to do with their
computing times and storage requirements.
<b>Space Complexity:</b>

     The space complexity of an algorithm is the amount of memory 
it needs to run to completion.
<code><font size=2>
1)Example: Algorithm abc(a,b,c)
{
return a+b+b*c+(a+b-c)/(a+b)+4.0;
}

Algorithm abc computes a+b+b*c+(a+b-c)/(a+b)+4.0;

2)Example: Algorithm sum(a,n)
[ s:=0.0;
for i:=1 to n do
s:=s+a[i];
return s;
}
			  n
Algorithm sum computes ∑a[i] iteratively where the a[i] s 
are real numbers.
			I=1
3)Example: Algorithm Rsum(a,n)
{
if(n<=0) then return 0.0;
else return Rsum(a,n-1)+a[n];
} 
							n
Algorithm Rsum is a recursive algorithm that computes ∑a[i];
							i=1
</font></code>
     The space needed by each of these algorithms is seen to be the
sum of the following components
1.A fixed part that is independent of the characteristics of the
input and outputs this part typically includes the instruction space 
(that is space for the code) space for simple variables and fixed
size component variables (also called aggregate) space for constants 
and so on.
2.A variable part that consists of the space needed by component
variables whose size is dependent on the particular problem instance 
being solved,the space needed by referenced variables and recursion 
stack space.
* the space required s(p) of any algorithm p may therefore be written
as s(p)=c+sp(instance characteristics) where c is a constant.
When analyzing the space complexity of an algorithm,we concentrate 
solely on estimating sp.

<b>Time Complexity:-</b>

      The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of computer 
time it needs to run to completion. The time T(p) taken by a program P 
is the sum of compile time and the run time. The compile time does not
depend on instance characteristic consequently we concern ourselves with 
just the runtime of the program.
This runtime is denoted by (instance characteristics) tp.
tp(n)=CaADD(n)+Cm MUL(n)+cd DIV(n)+------------
where n denotes the instance characteristics,and Ca,Cs,Cm,Cd and so on
respectively,denote the time needed for an addition subtraction,
multiplication, division and so on and ADD,SUB,MUL,DIV and so on are
functions whose values are the number of additions,subtractions,
multiplications,divisions and so on that are performed when the code
for p is used on an instance with characteristic n.
Obtaining such an exact formula is in itself an impossible task since 
the time needed for an addition,subtraction and depends on the numbers 
being added, subtracted and so on. 
The value of tp(n) for any given n can be obtained experimentally . The
execution time is physically clocked and tp(n) obtained. We can go one
step further and count only the number of program steps.
A program step is loosely defined as a syntactically or semantically 
meaningful segment of a program that has an execution time that is 
independent of the instance characteristics.
The number of steps any program statement is assigned depends on the 
kind of statement. For example ,comments count as zero steps,in an
iterative statement such as the for ,while and repeat until statements,
we consider the step count only for the control part of the statement.
The control parts for ‘for’ and ‘while’ statements have the 
following forms:
for i:=[expr] to [expr1] do
while[(expr)] do
Each execution of the control part of a ‘while’ statement given a 
step count equal to the number of step counts assignable (expr).
The step count for each execution of the control part of a for statement
is one, unless the counts attributable to and are functions of the 
instance characteristics. In this latter case, the first execution of 
the control part of the for has a step count equal to the sum of the 
counts for and .

<b>Methods to determine the step count:-</b>

1.We introduce a new variable,count into the program. This is a global 
variable with initial value 0. when the statement s to increment count 
are introduced into Algorithm sum,the result is
1.Algorithm sum(a,n)
2.{
3.s:=0.0;
4.count:=count+1://count is global; it is initially zero
5.for i:=1 to n do
6.{
7.count:count+1;//for for
8.s:=s+a[i];count:=count+1;//for assignment
9.}
10.count:=count+1;//for last time of for
11.count:=count+1;//for the return
12.return s;
13.}
A simplified version of the above algorithm is
1.Algorithm Sum(a,n)
2.{
3.for i:=1 to n do count:=count+2;
4.count:=count+3;
5.}
Both the algorithms compute the same final value for count. In the for 
loop,the value of count will increase by a total of 2n. If count is zero
to start with,then it will be 2n+3 steps.
