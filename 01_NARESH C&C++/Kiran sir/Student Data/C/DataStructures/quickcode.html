Pseudo code for Quick sort is :<br>
1.If the input array A is empty or has only one element , then Return.<br>
2.Select first element, called pivot , of array A.<br>
3.partition the array into two, so that the elements less than or equal to pivot are towards the left and those greater than towards to right, relative to pivot.<br>
4.Call Quick sort procedure recursively to sort left and right sub arrays respectively.<br>
   The Quick sort can be implemented either iterative or recursive. The recursive algorithm is simple and easy to understand.<br>
