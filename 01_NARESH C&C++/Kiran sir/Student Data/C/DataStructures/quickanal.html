Analysis of Quick sort :<br>
	    Like Merge sort, Quick sort is recursive and hence its analysis requires solving a recurrence formula.<br>
	  We will do this for a quick sort, assuming a random pivot and no cutoff for small files.<br>
	  The running time of quick sort is equal to the running time of two recursive calls plus the linear time spent in the partition.<br>
	The basic Quick sort relation is <br>
			T(n)  = T(i) + T(n-i-1) + Cn<br>
		where i= |s1| is the number of elements in s1.	<br>
          Worst-case Analysis :<br>
	The pivot is the smallest element all the time. Then  i=0 and if we ignore T(0) = 1, which is significant, the recurrence is<br>
	  	T(n) = T(n-1) + Cn , n>1<br>
		T(n-1) = T(n-2) + C(n-1)<br>
		T(n-2) = T(n-3) + C(n-2)<br>
		    .<br>
		    .<br>
		T(2) = T(1) + C(2)<br>
	Adding up all these equations we get<br>

	    T(n) = T(1) + Câˆ‘<sub>i=2</sub>  i = O(n<sup>2</sup>)<br>
                                                 
           Best-case Analysis :<br>
	In this case the pivot is in the middle.<br>
	T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Cn<br>
	divide both sides by n<br>
	T(n)/n = T(n/2)/(n/2) + C<br>
	T(n/2)/(n/2) = T(n/4)/(n/4) + C<br>
	and<br>
			T(n/4)/(n/4)  =  T(n/8)/(n/8) + C<br>
				.<br>
				.<br>
				.<br>
			T(2)/2 = T(1)/1 + C<br>
		Now add up all the equations. After everything is added the final result is because all of the other terms cancel and there are logn equations , and so all the 1s at the end of these equations add up to logn.<br>
		T(n)/n = T(1)/1 + logn<br>
	Multiplying through by n gives the final answer.<br>
		T(n) =  Cnlogn + n<br>
		       = O(nlogn)
