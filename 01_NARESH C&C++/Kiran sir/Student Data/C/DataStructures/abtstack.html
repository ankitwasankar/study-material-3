 <html> <strong>                                                   STACK:</strong><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A stack is  an ordered collection of items into which new items may be inserted and from which items may be deleted at one end,called the top of the stack..
  <br><br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike that of the array ,the definition of the stack provides 4 the insertion and deletion of items So that a stack is a dynamic,constantly changing object. The object definition specifies the single end of link list new items may be put on the top of the stack or items.<br>

<b>EXAMPLE:-</b><br>

           TOP<br><table border="1" align="center"><tr><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;           </TD></tr><tr><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD></tr>
<tr><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD></tr>
<tr><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD></tr>
<tr><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD></tr>
<tr><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD></tr></table>
 

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                The  F is physically higher on the page than all the other items in the stack. We simply that F is current top element in the stack .If any new items are added to that stack,they r placed at the top of F.<br>
                    
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          If any  item is deleted that is placed at the F is deleted,The last element insert into a stack. So its called as LIFO last-in -first-out.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                 In fact we have actually taken an extended view of what is really observed in a stack.<br>
<b>PRIMITIVE OPERATIONS:-</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                  The two changes which can be made to a stack to the given special case
When an item is added to the stack that is &#034; push&#034; And if any item ids deleted from the stack that is pop of stack. That is adding gives PUSH and Deletion gives the &#034;POP&#034; of stack operations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I=pop(s).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   
Since PUSH operation which adds element to a stack is called &#034;push down list&#034;
         There is no upper limit on the number items that may be kept in stack. Since the definition does not specify how many onto stack merely produces  a larger. However if a stack merely produces a collection of more items .However it contains th single item of a stack is popped. The resulting stack is called the &#034;EMPTY STACK&#034;.
