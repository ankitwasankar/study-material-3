<strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong>
Graphs are mathematically structures and are found very 
useful in problem solving.
Graphs provide an excellent way to describe the essential 
features of many applications.
Graph is a set of nodes (or vertices ) and edges (or arcs)
which connect them. 

<div align="center">G= (V,E)</div>

where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of edges.
A set of edges E are such that E={(vi,vj)} where vi,vj ?V. 
That is each edge in a graph is specified by a pair of 
nodes. 

Example:

    A Graph could be viewed as a map of what cities are 
connected by train routes. Viewing in this way ,each vertex
represents a particular city and each edge represents 
whether there is a train route for one city to  another.

If two nodes are connected by an edge those two nodes are 
said to be adjacent (or neighbours ). That is ,nodes v1 and
v2 are adjacent if there is an edge (v1,v2) or (v2,v1).

<div align="center">	<img src="undirectedgraph1.jpg" align="middle"></div>

In the above fig  Vertices adjacent to node 3 are 1,5,6 and
4 and that to node  2 are 1 and 4.An edge which has 
direction is called &#034;directed edge&#034;. That means , 
directed edge is &#034;unidirectional&#034;.It goes from 
one node to  another.

<div align="center"><img src="directedgraph1.jpg" align="middle"></div>

In the above fig there is a edge from B to C but there is
no edge representing reverse relationship(from C to B).The
edge which has no specific direction is  called #034; undirected edge&#034;.

If a node doesn't have any adjacent nodes,then it is said 
to be #034;isolated&#034;.node 8 in the above fig is 
isolated  node .A graph which contains only isolated nodes
is called a &#034;null graph&#034;

A directed  graph(or digraph) is a graph in which all 
edges are directed  edges.

An undirected  graph is a graph in which all edges are 
&#034;undirected  edges&#034;.A graph which contain both 
directed and undirected edges is said to be mixed graph.

An edge in a graph  which starts and ends on the same node
is called a  &#034;loop&#034;.A loop can be considered 
either a directed  or undirected since there is no 
significance.

A pair of nodes may be connected by more than one edge .
Such edges are referred to a parallel. A #034; 
MultiGraph&#034; is a graph in which there are some 
parallel edges .A simple graph is a graph in which there
are no parllel edges.

The &#034;Degree&#034; of a node is the number of edges 
connected directly to that node , i.e., the number of 
edges incident on it.

<div align="center"><img src="graph.jpg" align="middle"></div>

In a directed graph,the &#034;in degree&#034; of a node is
the number of edges beginning from the node .The &#034;out
degree&#034; of a node is the number of edges terminating
at that node.

In the above fig the in degree of a node B is 2 and out 
degree of a node B is 1.The sum of in degree and out 
degree of a node is the total degree of that node . In 
case of undirected graphs ,total degree is nothing but 
degree itself . The concept of in degree and out degree 
can not apply to undirected graph . A node whose in degree
os 0 is called a &#034;source node&#034; and a node whose 
out degree is 0 is called  &#034;sink node&#034;.for i
solate nodes,the degree is 0.

A &#034;weighted  graph&#034; is a graph that has a number
( weight) associated with each edge.<br>

Examples of 
Weighted graphs are:-

1)Airline flight information in which the nodes are 
airports(cites) and the edges are flights .The weights 
could be ticket prices,or distances.
2)A computer network 
in which the nodes are computers and the edges are 
communication lines .The weights could be line bandwidth.

3)A natural gas distribution system in which nodes are 
storage tanks and edges are pipes. Weights could be pipe 
capacity or distance.

A path P of length  k,in a graph is a sequence of connected
vertices v1,v2,v3,........vk such that (vi,vi+1) ? E for 
1&#060;=i&#060;k.

 The number of edges in a path is the  length of that path.

A simple path in a graph is a path such that all nodes are 
distinct,except that the first and last could be same .A 
&#034;cycle&#034; in a graph is a path of length atleast 3
 which has the first and last nodes are same. i.e., the 
path begins and ends on the same node .A directed graph is
a cyclic if it has no cycles.

A graph is said to be connected , if a path exists from 
any node to any other node . A digraph with this property
is said to be strongly connected, i.e., a directed path 
exists from any node to any other node . If a digraph is 
not strongly connected then it is said to be weakly 
connected .A graph is said to be complete graph if there is
an edge between  every pair of nodes. A tree is nothing but
a complete graph without any cycles.
