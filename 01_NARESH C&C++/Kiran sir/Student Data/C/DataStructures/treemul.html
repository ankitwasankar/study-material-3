<strong>Multiple Choice Questions</strong>

1. Consider the following tree.
                                         


 





If this tree is used for sorting, then a new number 8 should be placed as the
a) left child of node labeled 30
b)right child of node labeled 5
c)right child of node labeled 30
d) left child of node labeled 10
ANS: d
Explanation: If it is to be used for sorting , label of left child should be less than the label of the current node. So, coming down the tree , we get left child of node labeled 10 as the correct slot for 8.
2.No. of possible ordered trees with 3 nodes A,B,C is
a) 16
b) 12
c) 14
d) 13
     ANS: b
3. A binary tree in which every non-leaf node has non-empty left and right subtrees s called a    strictly binary tree.Such a tree with 10 leaves
a) cannot have more than 19 nodes
b) has exactly 19 nodes
c) has exactly 17 nodes
d) cannot have more than 17 nodes
     ANS: b
    Explanation: A strictly binary tree with ‘n’ leaves must have  (2n-1) nodes. Verify for some small ‘n’. This can be proved by the principle of the mathematical induction.
4.The depth of a complete binary tree with ‘n’ nodes is
a)  log(n+1)-1
b)  log(n)
c) log(n-1)+1
d) log(n)+1
Here log is to the base 2
    ANS: a
Explanation: If the depth s ‘d’, then 
                      No. of nodes n= 2(d+1)-1
                       n+1=2(d+1)
                       d=log(n+1)-1
5.Which of the following traversal techniques lists the nodes of a binary search tree n ascending order.
a) Post-order
b) In-order
c) Pre-order
d) none
6.Average successful search time taken by binary search on a sorted array of 10 items is
a) 2.6
b) 2.7
c) 2.8
d) 2.9
     ANS: d
     Explanation: The 10 items i1,i2,........i10 may be arranged in a binary  search tree as shown below
              








Here average = (1+(2+2)+(3+3+3+3)+(4+4+4)) /10 = 2.9
 So to match i5, the no. of comparisons needed is 1. For i2 is 2, for i8 is 2, for i1 it is 3 and so on
we get the result as 2.9.
7.A binary tree T has n leaf nodes. The no. of nodes of degree 2 in T is
a) log2n
b) n
c) n-1
d) 2n
    ANS: c
   Explanation: It can be proved by induction that a strictly binary tree with ‘n’ leaf nodes will have a total of 2n-1 nodes.
Therefore, no. of non-leaf nodes = (2n-1)-n = n-1

8.The no. of binary trees with 3 nodes which when traversed in Post-order gives the sequence A,B,C is
a) 3
b) 9
c) 7
d) 5
   ANS: d
Explanation: Here we get these five trees from three nodes as shown below.








9.The expression tree given n figure evaluates to 1, if

                                      












            a) a=-b & c=0
            b) a=-b & c=1
c) a=b & c=0
d)a=b & c=1
            ANS: b
           Explanation: The corresponding expression is -(-a-b)+c!. This is 1 if a=-b & c s either 1 or 0
                                 since 1!=0  0!=1.
