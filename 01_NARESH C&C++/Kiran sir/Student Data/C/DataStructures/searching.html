<pre>
<font size="2">
<strong>Linear Search:</strong> 

      Terms to be known before considering specific search 
techniques are:
(1)A table or file:-Is a group of elements each of which a record.
(2)Associated with each record is a key which is used to 
differentiate among different records.For every file there is
atleast one set of keys that is unique such akey is called a 
Primary key.
EX:- if the file is stored in an array the index within the array of
an element is a unique such a key is called a primary key.

      Keys need not always be unique. for example,in a file of names
and addresses if the state is used as akey for a particular search
it will probably not be unique,since there may be two records with
the som e state in the file .Such a key is called a Secondary key.

      A search algorithm is an algorithm that depends upon argument
‘a’ and tries to find a record whose key is ‘a’ .It may 
return the entire record or more commonly it may be return a pointer
to that record.If there is no record in the table with that argument
the algorithm may return a special nullrecord. Or a Null pointer.
Very often ,if a search is a Unsuccessful it may be desirable to add 
a new record with the argument as its key.An algorithm that does this
is called a search and insertion algorithm.
       
     A Successful search is often called a retrival a table of records
in which a key is used for retrival is often called a searchtable or
Dictionary searcher in which the entire tble in constantly in main 
memory are called internal searches,where as those in the which most
of the table is kept as a auxilary storage are called external 
searches. Notations:-K(i) denotes the ith key . Key of the record to
be pointed by p as K(p). Similarly the corresponding record is r(i)
or r(p). Two of the widely used search methods are Linear or 
sequential search and Binary search. SEQUENTIAL SEARCH The simplest
form of a seach is the sequential search.This search is applicable 
to a table organized either as an array or as a linked list.Let us 
assume that K is an array of n keys .K(0) through ,k(n-1) and r an 
array of records ,r(0)through r(n-1) such that the key is a search 
argument .We wish to return the smallest integer i such that K(i) 
equals to the key .If such an i exists and -1 otherwise.

<b>The algorithm for doing this is as follows.</b>
<code><font size=2>
For(i=0;i<n;i++)
if(key==k(i))
return(i);
return(-1);
The algorithm examines each key in turn ,upon finding one that mathes
the search argument ,its index is returned .If no match is found -1 
is returned.
This algorithm can be modified easily to add a record with key to the
t able if key is not already there .The last statement is modified 
that record.
K(N)=key
r(n)=rec;
n++;
return(n-1);
When the above algorithm is implement in C,we must ensure that 
incrementing n does not make its value go beyond the upper bound of
the array .To use a sequential insertion search on an array,
sufficent storage must hve been previously allocated for the array. 
An even more efficient search method involvs inserting the argument 
key at the end of the array sufficient storage must have been
previously allocated for the array.
K(n)=key
for(i=0;key!=k(i);i++)
if(i<n)
return(i);
else
return(-1);
for a search and insertion the entire ,if statement is replaced by
if(i==n)
r(n++)=rec;
return(i);
The extra key inserted at the end of the array is called a sentinel.
Storing a table as a Linked list has the advantage that the size
of the table can be the increased dynamically as needed ,Let us 
assume that the table linked by a pointer field next.Then assuming 
K,r,key and rec as before ,the sequential insertion search for a 
linked list may be written as follows: q=NULL;
for(p=table;p!=NULL&&0(p)!=Key;p=next(p)) q=p;
if(p!=NULL)
return(p);
/* insert a new node */
S=getnode();
K(s)=key;
r(s)=rec;
Next(s)=NULL;
If(q==Null)
table=s;
else
next(q)=s;
return(s);
    
     The efficiency of searching a list can be improved by adding a
sentinel node containing the argument key to the end of the list
before beginning the search so that the condition in the for loop 
is the simple condition K(p)1=key. Deleting a record from a table
stored as an unordered array is implemented by replacing the record
to be deleted. With the last record in the array and reducing the 
table size by 1.If the array is ordered in some way ,this method can 
not be used and half the elements in the array must be moved on the
average. If thre table is stored in a linked list ,it is quite
efficient to delete an element regardless of the ordering. 
EFFICIENCY OF LIEAR EARCH:- To find the number of key comparisions 
for a successful match ,we can add the number required for 
eachcomparision and divide by the total number of elements in the 
list.This would give:
1+2+3+...........+n/n =n(n+1)/2n -(n+1)/2

      In any case the number of comparisions is O(n). It would be 
helpful to have an algorithm that continually recorders. The table 
sothat more frequently accessed records drift to the back. There 
are two search methods that accomplish this .One of this is known 
as the move-to-front method and is efficient only for a table 
organized as a list .In this method ,Whenever a search is successful,
the retrived record is removed from its current location in the list 
and is placed at the head of the list. The other method is the
transportation method . In which a successfully retrived record is 
interchanged with the record that is interchanged with the record 
that immediately preceeds it.An algorithm to implement the 
transposition method on a table stored as a linked list as below.
The algorithm returns a pointer to the retrived record,or the NULL
pointer if the record is not the found.As before ,key is the 
search argument K and r are the tables of keys and records tabl is
a pointer to the first node of the list.
Q=s=NULL; /* q is the step behind p;*/
/*s is two steps behind p*/
for(p=table;P!+null&&k(p)!=key;p=next(p))
{
s=q;
q=p;
if(p==NULL)
return(p);
/*we have to found the record at position p*/
if(q==NULL)
/*No transposition is necessary */
return(p);
next(q)=next(p)
next(p)=q;
(s=null)?table=p:next(s)=p;
return(p);
     However the move-to-front method yields better results for a small
to medium number of requires and responds more quickly to a change in 
probability distribution .It also has better worst case behaviour 
than does transposition.
     For this reason ,Move-to-front is prefered in most practical 
situations involving sequential search. One advantage of the 
transposition method over the move-to-front method is that it can
be applied efficiently to tables are stored in array form as well 
as to list structure tables.

<b>SEARCHING AN ORDERED TABLE:- </b>

      If the table is stored in aparticular order of the record keys,
there are several techniques that can be used to improve the efficiency 
of searching.One obvious advantage in searching a sorted file over the
unsorted fileis in the case that the argument key is absent from the
file .In unsorted file n,comparisions where assorted as n/2 comparisions.
Morever in an ordred file table,each request willonly few lookup or
perhaps only a single comparision.Because of the simplicity and
efficiently of sequential search on sorted files.

<b>Indexed Sequential seaarch:</b>
       Is a technique to improve search efficiency for a sorted file,
but it involvs an increase in the amount of he space required.An 
auxillary table called an index is set aside in addition to the stored
file itself.
Each element in the index consists of a key kindex and pointer to the 
record in the file.must be stored on the key.If the index is one eight
the size of the file,every eight record of the file is shows a index.
