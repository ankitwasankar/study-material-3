<strong>Introduction:</strong> 

<b>Definition:-</b>
<p>        The method of solving a problem is known as an algorithm.
It is a sequence of instructions that act on some input data to 
produce some output in a finite number of steps.</p>
<b>Properties:-</b>
a) Input:An algorithm must receive some input data supplied externally.
b)Output:An algorithm must produce atleast one output as the result.
c)Finiteness:The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
d)Definiteness:The steps to be performed in the algorithm must be clear 
and unambiguous.
e)Effectiveness:One must be able to perform the steps in the algorithm 
without applying any intelligence.
<p>   All algorithms basically fall under two broad categories-Iterative 
and Recursive algorithms.</p><p>   Iterative Algorithms typically use loops and conditional statements.</p><p>   Recursive Algorithms use a divide and Conquer strategy. As per this,
the recursive algorithm breaks down a large problem into small pieces and 
then applies the algorithm to each of these smal pieces. Determining which
algorithm is efficient than the other involves analysis of algorithms. 
While analyzing,time required to execute it determined .’time’ 
represents the number of operations that are carried out while executing 
the algorithm.</p><p>     While analyzing iterative algorithms we need to determine how many 
times the loop is executed. To analyze a recursive algorithm one needs to
determine amount of work done for three things:</p>i.breaking down the large problem to smaller pieces.
ii.Getting solution for each piece and combining the individual solutions 
to get the solution to the whole problem.
iii.Combining this information and the number of the smaller pieces and 
their sizes,we then need to create a recurrence relation for the algorithm.

<b>Analysis:- </b> 
      The analysis of an algorithm provides information that gives us a 
general idea of how long an algorithm willtake for solving a problem.For
comparing the performance of two algorithms we have to esimate the time 
taken to solve a problem using each algorithm for a set of N input values.
      Analysis of algorithms give us the scientific reason to determine which 
algorithm should be chosen to solve the problem. The purpose of determining 
the number of comparisions is to then use them to figure out which of the 
algorithms under consideration can solve the problem more efficiently.

<b>What Analysis Doesn’t Do:-</b>
       The analysis of algorithms does not give a formula that helps us 
determine how amny seconds or computer cycles a particular algorithm will 
take to solve a problem. The analysis of algorithm should be done regardless 
of the computer on which the program that implements the algorithm is going 
to get executed.

<b>Things to Count and Consider:-</b>
i.The significant operatio or operations in the algorithm must be
identified first.
ii.Operations integral to the algorithm and which merely contribute to the 
overheads should be determined next.
Comparision or arithmetic are two classes of operations that typically chosen
for the significant operation.

<b>Cases To Consider During Analysis:-</b>
Multiple input sets must be considered while analyzing an algorithm.
<b> a)Best Case Input:-</b>
This represents the input set that allows an algorithm to perform most
quickly with this input the algorithm takes shortest time to execute, 
as it causes the algorithms to do the least amount of work. No matter how
large is the input,searching in a best case will result in a constant time 
of 1. Since the best case for an algorithm would usually be very small and 
frequently constant value,a best case analysis is often not done.
<b>b)Worst Case Input:-</b>
This represents the input set that allows an algorithm to perform more
slowly.Worst case is an important analysis because it gives us an idea of 
the most time an algorithm will ever take. Worst case analysis requires that 
we identify the input values that cause an algorithm to de the most work.
<b>c)Average Case Input:</b>
This represents the input ser that allows an algorithm to deliver an average 
performance. Doing average case analysis is a four step process.

<b>These steps are as follows:</b>
i.Determine the number of different groups into which all possible input sets
can be divided.
ii.Determine the probability that the input will come from each of these 
groups.
iii.Determine how long the algorithm will run for each of these groups.
All of the input in each group should take the same amount of time,amd if 
they do not,the group must be split into separate groups.

<b>Calculate average case time using the formula:</b>
<code><font size=2>        m
	A(n)=∑pi*ti where
	i=1
	n=size of input
	m=number of groups
	pi=probability that the input will be from group i
        ti= time that the algorithm takes for input from group i.
</font></code>		
<b>Rates Of Growth:-</b>
     While doing analysis of algorithm we must consider what happens when 
the size of the input is large, because small input sets can hide rather 
dramatic differences.
     Algorithms can be groped into three categories based on the order of 
the function or related algorithm.
   a)Algorithm that grow atleast as fast as same function.
   b)Algorithms that grow at the same rate.
   c)Algorithms that grow no faster.
     The categories mentioned above are commenly known as Big Omega Ω (f),
Big oh O(f) and Big Theta Ө(f) respectively.
     Of these, the Big Omega category of functions is not of much interest
o us since for all values of ‘n’ greater than same threshold value no 
all the functions in Ω (f) have values that are at least as large as f(i.e)
all functions in this category grow as fast as f or even faster. Big Oh O(f)
category represents the class of functions that grow no faster than f. This
means that for al values of n greater than same threshould number all the 
functions in O(f) have values that are no greater than f.
