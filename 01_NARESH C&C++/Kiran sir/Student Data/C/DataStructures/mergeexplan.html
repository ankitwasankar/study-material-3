Merge sort runs in O(n logn) worst case running time and the number of comparisons used is nearly optimal.<br>
		It is a fine example of recursive algorithm.<br>
		The fundamental operation in this algorithm is merging two sorted lists. Because the lists are sorted, this can be done in one pass through the input if the output is put in a third list.<br>
		The basic merging algorithm takes two input arrays a and b, an output array c, and three counters , aptr ,bptr and cptr, which are initially set to the beginning of their respective arrays. The smaller of a[aptr] and b[bptr] is copied to the next entry in c, and the appropriate counters are advanced. When either input list is exhausted, the remainder of the other list is copied to c.
