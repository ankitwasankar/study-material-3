	As the name suggests, quick sort or partition exchange sort is a fast sorting algorithm invented by C.A.R. Hoare. It is based on the recognition that exchanges should preferably be performed over large distances in order to be most effective. Its average running time is O(nlogn). It is very fast, mainly because of a very tight and highly optimized inner loop. It has O(nÂ²) worst-case performance, but this can be made exponentially unlikely with a little effort.<br>
	The quick sort algorithm is simple to understand and prove correct, although for many years it had the reputation of being an algorithm that could in theory be highly optimized but in practice it was impossible to code correctly.<br>
	Like Merge sort, quick sort is a Divide and Conquer recursive algorithm.
	In quick sort we divide the array of items to be sorted into two partitions and then call the quick sort procedure recursively to sort the two partitions. To partition the data elements , a pivot element is to be selected such that all the items in the lower part are less than the pivot and all those in the upper part greater than it.<br>
	Consider an array A of N elements to be sorted. Select a pivot element among the N elements. The selection of pivot element is somewhat arbitrary. However , the first element is  a convenient one.<br>
	The array is divided into two partitions so that the pivot element is placed into its proper position satisfying the following properties.<br>
	1.All elements to the left of pivot are less than the pivot element.<br>
	2.All elements to the right of pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot element<br></body></html>
