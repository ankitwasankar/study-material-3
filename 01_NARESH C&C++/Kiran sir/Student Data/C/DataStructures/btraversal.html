<strong>TRAVERSING A BINARY TREE:</strong><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traversing a tree means that processing is so that each node is visited exactly once. A binary tree can be traversed n number ways. They differ primarily In the  order In which they visit the nodes. The most common three traversals are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Pre-order<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.In-order<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.Post-order<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binary trees , like self-referential structures, are inherently recursive n nature. That is , any given node of a tree can itself be viewed as the root of another tree. That makes the use of recursive calls relatively straightforward for working with trees.
