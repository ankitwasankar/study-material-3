<A NAME="Heading5"></A>Dedication</FONT></H2>
<P>This book is dedicated to the living memory of David Levine.
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="Heading6"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Acknowledgments</FONT></H2>
<P>A second edition is a second chance to acknowledge and to thank those folks without
whose support and help this book literally would have been impossible. First among
them are Stacey, Robin, and Rachel Liberty.</P>
<P>I must also thank everyone associated with my books, both at Sams and at Wrox
press, for being professionals of the highest quality. The editors at Sams did a
fantastic job, and I must especially acknowledge and thank Fran Hatton, Mary Ann
Abramson, Greg Guntle, and Chris Denny.</P>
<P>I have taught an online course based on this book for a couple years, and many
folks there contributed to finding and eradicating bugs and errors. A very large
debt is owed to these folks, and I must especially thank Greg Newman, Corrinne Thompson,
and also Katherine Prouty and Jennifer Goldman.</P>
<P>I would also like to acknowledge the folks who taught me how to program: Skip
Gilbrech and David McCune, and those who taught me C++, including Steve Rogers and
Stephen Zagieboylo. I want particularly to thank Mike Kraley, Ed Belove, Patrick
Johnson, Mike Rothman, and Sangam Pant, all of whom taught me how to manage a project
and ship a product.</P>
<P>Others who contributed directly or indirectly to this book include: Scott Boag,
David Bogartz, Gene Broadway, Drew and Al Carlson, Frank Childs, Jim Culbert, Thomas
Dobbing, James Efstratiou, David Heath, Eric Helliwell, Gisele and Ed Herlihy, Mushtaq
Khalique, Matt Kingman, Steve Leland, Michael Smith, Frank Tino, Donovan White, Mark
Woodbury, Wayne Wylupski, and Alan Zeitchek.</P>
<P>Programming is as much a business and creative experience as it is a technical
one, and I must therefore acknowledge Tom Hottenstein, Jay Leve, David Rollert, David
Shnaider, and Robert Spielvogel.</P>
<P>Finally, I'd like to thank Mrs. Kalish, who taught my sixth-grade class how to
do binary arithmetic in 1965, when neither she nor we knew why.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="Heading8"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Introduction</FONT></H2>
<P>This book is designed to help you teach yourself how to program with C++. In just
21 days, you'll learn about such fundamentals as managing I/O, loops and arrays,
object-oriented programming, templates, and creating C++ applications--all in well-structured
and easy-to-follow lessons. Lessons provide sample listings--complete with sample
output and an analysis of the code--to illustrate the topics of the day. Syntax examples
are clearly marked for handy reference.</P>
<P>To help you become more proficient, each lesson ends with a set of common questions
and answers, exercises, and a quiz. You can check your progress by examining the
quiz and exercise answers provided in the book's appendix.
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="Heading9"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Who Should Read This
Book</FONT></H4>
<P>You don't need any previous experience in programming to learn C++ with this book.
This book starts you from the beginning and teaches you both the language and the
concepts involved with programming C++. You'll find the numerous examples of syntax
and detailed analysis of code an excellent guide as you begin your journey into this
rewarding environment. Whether you are just beginning or already have some experience
programming, you will find that this book's clear organization makes learning C++
fast and easy.

<P>This book uses various typefaces to help you distinguish C++ code from regular
English. Actual C++ code is typeset in a special <TT>monospace</TT> font. Placeholders--words
or characters temporarily used to represent the real words or characters you would
type in code--are typeset in italic monospace. New or important terms are typeset
in italic.</P>
<P>In the listings in this book, each real code line is numbered. If you see an unnumbered
line in a listing, you'll know that the unnumbered line is really a continuation
of the preceding numbered code line (some code lines are too long for the width of
the book). In this case, you should type the two lines as one; do not divide them.<BR>
