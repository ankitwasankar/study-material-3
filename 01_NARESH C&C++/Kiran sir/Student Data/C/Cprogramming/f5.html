<pre>
<font size="2">
 
1) There is a mistake in the following code, add a statement
   in it to remove it.
   main()
   {
    int a;
    a=f(10,3.14)
    printf("%d",a);
   }
  f(int aa,float bb)
  {
   return((float)aa+bb);
  }

 Ans: Add the function prototype in main()
      float f(int,float);

2) What error would the following function give on 
   compilation?
   f(int a, int b)
   {
    int a;
    a=20;
    return a;
   }
 A. Missing parentheses in return statement
 B. The function should be defined as int 
    f(int a, int b)
 C.Redeclaration of a
 D.None of the above 

 Ans: C

3) In a function two return statements should never 
   occur successfully.
    TRUE or FALSE
 
 Ans: TRUE

4) In C all functions except main() can be called 
   recursively. TRUE / FALSE

   Ans: FALSE

5) Point out the error in the following code.
   main()
   {
    int a=10;
    void f();
    a=f();
    printf("\n %d",a);
   }
   void f()
   {
    printf("\n Hi");
   }

 Ans: Inspite of defining the function f() as returning
 void, the program is trying to collect the value returned
 by f() in variable a.

6) Point out the error, if any in the following program.
   main()
   {
    int b;
    b=f(20);
    printf("%d",b);
   }
   int f(int a)
   {
    a>20 ? return(10) : return(20);
   }

 Ans: Return statement cannot be used as shown with the 
conditional operators. Instead the following statement
may be used.
        return(a>20 ? 10 : 20)

7) A function cannot be defined inside another function. 
   TRUE / FALSE

 Ans: TRUE

8) Will the following function  work?   YES/NO
    f1(int a, int b)
    {
      return(f2(20));
      f2(int a)
      {
        return(a*a);
      }
 Ans: YES

9) In a function two return statements should never occur.
  TRUE / FALSE

 Ans: FALSE

10) Usually recursion works slower than loops.
  TRUE / FALSE

   Ans: TRUE

11) Is it true that too many recursive calls may result 
    into stack overflow? YES / NO
    
   Ans: YES

12) What will be the output of the following program.

	main()
	{
	C()
	{
	c()
	{
	printf(" C is a C......\n");
	}
	printf(".......... is a c..\n");
	}
        printf(".......... is a sea afterall!");
	}

Output: Error message: Statement missing ; in function 
main The compiler reports an error saying there is a 
missing semicolon. But where is it missing? After C().
But suppose we only want to define the function C(),
logically we shouldn't be required to give a semi-colon
after C().That's the point. At the most you can call a 
function from within the body of another function. you 
are not allowed to define another function within the 
body of another function. And that is what the above 
program is attempting to do. It is trying to define C()
and c() in main(), which ia not acceptable,hence the error
message.

13) 
	main()
	{
	int z=4;
	printf("%d",printf("%d%d",z,z);
	}

Output: 4 4 3 
     Here the inner printf() is executed first, and it
prints out a 4, a space and another 4. Thus it totally 
prints out 3 characters. Whenever the printf() function 
is called it returns the number of characters it has
successfully managed to print.

14)
	main()
	{
	int i;
        printf("In the year of lord \n");
	for(i=1;i<font
	main();
	}
Output:  In the year of lord
         In the year of lord
         In the year of lord  
      ............................
      ............................
      ............................

15)
	      main()
      {	
       char a=65, ch='C';
       printit(a,ch);
      }
	printit(a,ch)
	{
         printf("a=%d ch=%c", a, ch);
	}

Output: a=65 ch=C

16)	main()
	{
	int i;
	for(i=1;i<=10;i++)
	main();
	printf("IEG");
	}

Output: No output First time the control reaches the for
loop main() gets called once again. This continues until 
the stack becomes full or until the user aborts the 
program through ctrl scroll-lock.

17)
	main()
	{
         void message();
         int c;
         printf("c before call=%d \n",c);
         c=message();
         printf("c after call=%d",c);
        }
	void message()
	{
         printf("Only he will survive who is c-fit");
	}

Output: Error message: Not an allowed type in function 
main Here the function message() will not return any 
value. And then we are trying to collect in the variable
c, the value returned by message().

18)
      main()
      {
	int c;
        printf("c before call=%d \n", c);
	c=message();
	printf("c after call=%d \n",c);
      }
      message()
      {
	printf("Live and Let live \n");
      }

Output: c before call=34
        Live and Let live
        c after call=457
     Since c has not been initialized in main() it contains
a garbage value.

19)
     main()
     {
       int k=35, z;
       k=func1(k=func1(k)));
       printf("k=%d",k);
     }
     func1(k)
     int k;
     {	
      k++;
      return(k);
     }

Output: k=38

20)
    main()
    {
     int i=10, j=20, k;
     k=addsub(i, j);
     printf("k=%d", k);
    }
    addsub(c,d)
    int c, d;
    {
     int x, y;
     x=c-d;
     y=c+d;
     return(x,y);
    }

Output: k=30

21)
    main()
    {
     int k=35, z;
     z=check(k);
     printf("z=%d", z);
    }
   check(m)
   {
     int m;
     if(m>40)
     return(!m++);
     else
     return(!++m);
   }

output: Error message: Redeclaration of 'm'in function
check The variable m used in check() has not been 
defined before the opening brace. Therefore it is 
assumed to be an integer variable.

22)   main()
      {
	int i=45;
	float c;
	c=check(i);
	printf("c=%f", c);
      }
	check(ch)
	int ch;
	{
     	ch>=45 ? return(3.14) : return(6.28);
        }

Output: c=3.000000
 
    Here, the condition ch>=45 is satisfied hence 3.14 
gets returned. Does it really? No, because by default 
any function is capable of returning only an int. Hence
3.14 gets truncated to 3 while returning the value.

23)C supports modular programming.

24)A function is a self contained program which is meant
 to do some specific well defined task.

25)Return statement is used to exit from the function.

26)A function can receive many values, but it can return 
only one value.

27)A function prototype tells the compiler the type of data 
arguments and their order,the type of data function returns,
number of arguments.

28)Parameters are used to communicate data between the 
calling and called function.

29)The four storage classes in c are automatic, static, 
external and register.

30)Recursion is a process of calling a function within the 
same function.

31)
	main()
	{	
	int i=3, k , l;
	k=add(++i);
	l=add(i++);
	printf("i=%d k=%d l=%d", i, k, l);
        }
	add(ii)
	{
	++ii;
	return(ii);
	}

Output: i=5 k=5 l=5
           Whenever the ++ operator proceeds the variable, 
first the variable's value is incremented and then used. As
against this whenever the ++ operator succeeds the variable,
its value is first used and then incremented. According to 
this rule the first call add(++i) would first increment i to
4 and then pass its value to function add(). In add() 4 is 
collected in ii,incremented to 5, returned to main() and 
finally stored in k.Hence k's value is printed as 5. In the 
next call, add(i++), the current value of i(i.e., 4) is first
sent to add() and then
 i's value is incremented to 5. In 
add() ii is incremented to 5, which is returned and collected
in l.

32)
    main()
    {
     int i=135, a=135, k;
     k=function(!++i,!a++)
     printf("i=%d a=%d k=%d",i,a,k);
    }
    function(j,b)
    int j,b;
    {
     int c;
     c=j+b;
     return(c);
    }

Output: i=136 a=136 k=0
    Since ++ preceeds i its value is incremented to 136, 
and then the ! operator negates its to give 0. This 0 is 
however not stored in i but is passed to function(). As 
against this while evaluating the expression !a++ , 
since ++ follows a, firstly a is negated to 0, this 0 is
passed to function() and a is incremented to 136.Thus 
what get passed to function() are 0 and 0,which are 
collected in j and b, added to give another o and finally
returned to main(), where it is collected in k and then 
printed out.

33)
    main()
    {
     int p=23, f=24;
     packman(p,f);
     printf("p=%d f=%d",p,f);
    }
     packman(q,h)
     int q, h;
     {
      q=q+q;
      h=h+h;
      return(q);
      return(h);
     }

Output: p=23 f=24

   In packman() q and h are doubled and then the return(q) 
is executed, which sends the control back to main() along
with the value q. But since this value is not collected in 
any variable in main() it just gets ignored. As a result p
and f stand unchanged at 23 and 24 respectively. The 
statement return(h) never gets executed, since the previous
return statement will not allow the control to reach there.

34)
	main()
	{
	int i=3,j;
	j=add(++i++);
        printf("i=%d j=%d \n", i, j);
	}	
	add(ii)
	int ii;
	{
         ii++;
         printf("ii=%d \n", ii);
	}

Output: Error message: Lvalue required in function main()

   'Lvalue' means a variable whose value can change or in 
other words,a variable which can occur on the Left hand side
of the assignment operator. Now look at the expression ++i++.
Here firstly i would be incremented to 4(due to the ++ 
operator before i) and the expression would become 4++. As a
result 4 would passed to add() and then would attempt to get
incremented owing to the operator that occurs after i.But 4 
cannot be incremented because it is not a variable. On L/H 
side of assignment operator a variable (lvalue) should occur.
This attempt would be made to evaluate 4++ as 4=4+1. Hence 
the error message.

35)
	main()
	{
	int k=35, *z, *y;
 	z=&k;   /* Suppose address of k is 1008 */
	y=z;
	*z++ = *y++;
        k++;
	printf("k=%d z=%d y=%d",k,z,y);
	}

Output: k=36 z=1010 y=1010
 
       In main() the address of k is stored in z and the
same address is then assigned to y. since y and z contain
address of an integer,they have been quite appropriately 
declared as integer pointer.Here the z and y pointers are
incremented to point to the next location. But before the
incrementation what is done is assignment.This is because 
++ is occuring after the variable names y and z. During 
assignment,value at the address contained in y(i.e.,35). 
After that the value of k is incremented to 36 and then 
printed out.

36)
    main()
    {
     int a=100, *b, **c ***d;
     b=&a;
     c=&b;
     d=&c;
     printf("%d%d%d%d", a, *b, **c, ***d);
    }

Output: 100 100 100 100
       Here b is an integer pointer, c is a pointer to an
integer pointer and d is called a pointer to a pointer to
an integer pointer.In printf() a would printout the value
100 which is straight forward.*b would print the value at
theaddresscontained n b. Since the address contained in b
is 4002, and the value at this address s 100,once again 
100 would get printed. C would give value at address 4002,
i.e., 100.The similar logic is applied to the output of 
***d,which would also be 100.

37)
     main()
     {
      float a=7999999;
      float *b, *c;
      b=&a;
      c=b;
      printf("%d%d%d",&a,b,c);
      printf(%d%d%d%d \n", a ,*(&a), *b, *c);
     }

Output: 4200    4200      4200

        0          24576    -3          16415

             The first printf() the address of a in three
different ways. In the second printf() we are attempting 
to print 7.999999 by applying pointer operator on a,b and
c. a, *(&a), *c all yield 7.999999 but when they are 
printed using %d, printf() blows it up as the output above
would justify. Don’t rely on printf() to truncate a float 
value to an integerwhile printing by using a %d.Vicevers 
also its true. These statements would not print 7.000000 .
Don’t be surprised if you get some odd value. In that sense 
%d & %f are a little unreliable.

38)
    main()
    {
      int i=-5, j=-2;
      junk(i, &j);
      printf("i=%d j=%d", i, j);
    }
    junk(i, j)
    int i, *j;
    {
      i=i * i;
     *j= *j * *j;
    }

Output: i= -5  j= 4

      Even though the value of i is changed to 25 in junk(),
this change will not be reflected back in main(). As against
this since j’s address is being passed to junk(),any change 
in junk() gets reflected back in main(). Hence  *j * *j which
evaluates to 4 is reflected bac in main().

39)
    main()
    {
     int  *c;
     c=heck(10,20);
     printf("c= %d", c);
    }
    check(i,j)
    int i,j;
    {
      int *p, *q;
      p=&i;
      q=&j;
      i=45 ? Return(p) : return(q);
    }

Output: Error message: Non portable pointer assignment in main

     Here, the conditional operators test the value of i 
against 45, and return either the address stored in q. It 
appears that this address would be collected in c in main(),
and then would be printed out. And there lies the error. 
The function check() is not capable of returning an integer 
pointer. All that it can return is an ordinary integer.Thus 
just declaring c as an integer pointer is not sufficient.
        int check();
    we must make the above modification in the program to 
make it work properly
