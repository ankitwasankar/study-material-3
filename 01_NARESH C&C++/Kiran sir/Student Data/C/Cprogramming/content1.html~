         <pre><h2>MANAGING INPUT AND OUTPUT OPERATIONS</h2></pre>

Introduction: Reading, processing and writing of data are the three essential functions of a computer 
Program.Most programs  take some data as input and  display the processed data often known as information or results.
There are two methods of providing data to the program data to the  programvariables.One method 
is to assign values to variables through the assignment statements such as x=5, a=0 and so on. Another 
method to use the input function scanf which can read data from a terminal. For outputting results the 
function printf which sends results out to a terminal is used.'C' does not have any built-in input and
output statements as part of its syntax .All input and output operations are carried out through function 
calls such as printf and scanf.There exits several functions that have more or less become standard for input 
and output operation in C.These functions are collectively known as i/o library. Each program that uses 
a standard input/output function must contain the statement, at the beginning.
                     #include'stdio.h' 
 The filename stdio.h is an  input-output header file.Theinstruction#include'stdio.h'tells the compiler 
to search for a file named stdio.h and place its contents at this point in the program. when it is compiled
thecontents of the header file become part of the  source code.
