<strong>OBJECTIVE TYPE QUESTIONS</strong>

What will be the output of the following programs:

1.main()
  {
               static char str[] ="Academy"
                    printf("%s\n%s",str,"Acemedy" );
     }
        a. Academy Academy              b.Error
        c.No Error                                d.None  

Output:    Academy Acamedy

Explanation:      We know that mentioning the name of a string yields the base address of the string.
            When this base address is passed to printf() it prints out each character in the string till it
 encounters '\0' sitting at the end of the string.A string written double quotes also gives the base address of the
 string.This base address when passed to printf() would result in printing "Acemedy"once again.


2.         main()
           {
                float  a=3.14;
                printf("%\na=%f",a);
                printf("%\na=%6.2f",a);
                printf("%\na=%-6.2f",a);
         printf("%\na=%6.1f",a);
                printf("%\na=%6.0f",a);
           }

Output:  a=3.140000
               a=  3.14
               a=3.14
               a=   3.1
               a=     3

Explanation:  The first printf() uses the format specification for a float,hence a gets printed as 3.140000,
 as bydefault a float is printed with 6 decimal places.In the next printf() the number that  precedes the f in %f is
 an optional specifier,which governs how exactly the varible is to be printed 6.2 signifies that the field width
 i.e the total number of columns that the values occupies on the screen,should be 6 and that the value should have 
 2 digits after the decimal point.Thus 3.14 is printed with blank spaces on the left,that is with right
 justification.
        For left justification,we use a minus sign with the specifiers,as is done in the next printf().It prints
 the value of a starting from the zeroth column,with only 2 decimal digits.The specification 6.1 prints 3.1 with
 right justification.
       In the last printf(),6.0 specifies zero decimal digits,have only 3 is dsplayed right justified.


3.           main()
            {
               printf("%20s\n","short leg"); 
              printf("%20s\na","long leg");
                printf("%20s\n","deep fine leg");
                printf("%20s\n","backward short leg");
                printf("%20s\n","legs all the same!");
               }

Output:                             shortleg
                                          longleg
                                  deep fine leg
                        backward short leg
                      legs all the same!

Explanation:  The output is right justified,as the field width specified with each %s is plus 20.For each string,
20 column are set aside,and the strings are printed with blanks filling up the remaining columns are on the left.


4. main()
   {  
         printf("hello\nhi\n");
         printf("hello\rhi");
   }

Output:      hello
               hi
               hillo

Explanation: The escape sequence '\n' called new line takes the cursor to the beginning of the next line.
 Hence with the first printf() "hello" and "hi" are printed on consective lines.A '\r' on the other hand,takes the
 cursor to the beginning of the same line in which the cursor is currently present.Hence,having printed "hello",the
 cursor is sent back at 'hi' is printed.The first two letters of "hello" are therefore written over,and we get the
 output as "hillo".


5.main()
  {  
    printf("%hello\b\b\b\b\b");
    printf("hi\b\b\bbye");
  }

Output:  byelo
Explanation:       The escape sequence '\b' stands for backspace which takes the cursor to the previous character.
In the first printf(), "hello" is printed, following which the cursor is positioned after 'o'.
Now the 5 backspaces take the cursor to the letter 'h' of "hello".
The control now passes to the second printf(),and "hi" is written over the first three characters of "hello" resulting 
in "hilo".Once again 3 backspaces are encountered,which take the cursor back at 'h' of "hi".Next "bye" is printed on top
of "hi".The "lo" that is seen has persisted from the first printf()'s."hello", as it never got overwritten.Hence the output
 "byelo".
 
 6.main()
   {
     printf(" i\tam\ta\tboy");
   }

Output:i am a boy

Explanation:  The message is printed with space inserted wherever the escape sequence '\t' occured.
 This sequence stands for a tab.In one compiler,the tabs had been setup after every 5 colunms,at 0,5,10 etc.
 Hence while executing printf(),when '\t' is encountered,the cursor skips to the immediately next column which is a
 multiple of 5,and then prints the next word.Thus 'i' is printed form the 15th column,"am" from the 5th,'a' from
 the 10th,and "boy" from the 15th column.Some compilers like turbo c allow you to change the tab settings,so that
 the tab widths can set up as desired.



7.                   #include<stdio.h>
                      main()
               {
                    char str1[30],str2[30];
                     printf("enter a sentence \n");
                     scanf("%s",str1);
                     printf("%s",str2);
                      fflush(stdin);
                    printf("\n enter a sentence \n");
                           gets(str2);
                     printf("%s",str2);
                }
Output:    enter a sentence
                  nothing succeeds like success
                  enter a sentence
                  nothing succeeds like success
                  nothing succeeds like success
 
Explanation: The scanf() suffers from the limitation that a maximum of only one word can be accepted by it.
 The moment a space(or a tab or a newline)is typed,scanf() assumes you have finished supplying information ,and
 hence ignores whatever follows.That's why,str[] stroes only "Nothing,as it is proved by the first output.To
 overcome this
  limitation,we have an unformatted console i/o function called gets().It accepts whatever u type from the keyboard
 till the enter key is hit.To be precise,get() accepts everything until a '\n' is encountered,which it replaces
 with a '\0' . 
   Thus the entire string that we entered is obtained in the second output.fflush() flushes out the current keyboard
 buffer 
   would be read by gets() .Since gets() is terminated on reading an enter key ,u won't get a chance to supply the
 2nd sentence.

8.                 #include<stdio.h>
                      main()
                  {
                                char name[20],name1[20];
                         int age,age1;
                         printf("enter name and age\n");
                             scanf("%s%d",name,&age);
                        printf("%s%d",name,age);
                        printf("\n enter name and age\n"); 
                        fscanf("stdin,"%s%d",name1,&age1);
                         printf("stdout,"%s%d",name1,age1);
                  }

Output: enter name and age
                  raj 18
              enter name and age

Explanation: Here the first set of statement comprising of prinf()s and scanf() is fairly simple.The fscanf() and
 fprintf() that follow next need some explaning.
      Fscanf( ) like scanf(),is used for formatted reading of data. The only difference is that the former takes an
 additional arugement that of a file pointer.
      This pointer indicates to the fscanf() from where the data is to be read. whereas scanf() is capable of
 reading data onlyfrom the keyboard.In the call to fsacnf() the file pointer stdin is being used ,which sands for
 standard input device i.e the keyboard.Since stdin is a pointer to a standard file,we do not need to use fopen()
 to open it,as it is always open for reading.The counterpart of fscanf() is fprintf().

        It too needs a file pointer as its first argument.Here the file pointer used is stdout,which stands for
 standard output device,i.e the display monitor.Thus using stdin in fscanf() 
 and stdout in fprint() makes them them work like the familiar scanf() and printf() functions.Hence both the sets
 collect the  names and ages from keyboard.
