What will be the output of the following programs:
1.main()
  {
   static char str[] ="Academy"
   printf("%s\n%s",str,"Acemedy");
  }
 a. Academy Academy              b.Error
 c.No Error                     d.None  

Output:    Academy Acamedy

Explanation:      We know that mentioning the name of a
string yields the base address of the string.When this
base address is passed to printf() it prints out each 
character in the string till it encounters '\0' sitting
at the end of the string.A string written double quotes
also gives the base address of the string.This base 
address when passed to printf() would result in printing
"Acemedy"once again.

2. main()
   {
    float  a=3.14;
    printf("%\na=%f",a);
    printf("%\na=%6.2f",a);
    printf("%\na=%-6.2f",a);
    printf("%\na=%6.1f",a);
    printf("%\na=%6.0f",a);
   }

Output:  a=3.140000
         a=  3.14
         a=3.14
         a=   3.1
         a=     3

Explanation:  The first printf() uses the format 
specification for a float,hence a gets printed as 
3.140000, as bydefault a float is printed with 6 
decimal places.In the next printf() the number that
precedes the f in %f is an optional specifier,which
governs how exactly the varible is to be printed 6.2
signifies that the field width i.e the total number 
of columns that the values occupies on the screen,
should be 6 and that the value should have 2 digits
after the decimal point.Thus 3.14 is printed with 
blank spaces on the left,that is with right
justification.

    For left justification,we use a minus sign with
the specifiers,as is done in the next printf().It 
prints the value of a starting from the zeroth column
,with only 2 decimal digits.The specification 6.1 
prints 3.1 with right justification.
    In the last printf(),6.0 specifies zero decimal 
digits,have only 3 is dsplayed right justified.

3.   main()
     {
      printf("%20s\n","short leg");
      printf("%20s\na","long leg");
      printf("%20s\n","deep fine leg");
      printf("%20s\n","backward short leg");
      printf("%20s\n","legs all the same!");
     }

Output:                             shortleg
                                          longleg
                                  deep fine leg
                        backward short leg
                      legs all the same!

Explanation:  The output is right justified,as the field
width specified with each %s is plus 20.For each string,
20 column are set aside,and the strings are printed with
blanks filling up the remaining columns are on the left.

4. main()
   {  
    printf("hello\nhi\n");
    printf("hello\rhi");
   }

Output:      hello
               hi
               hillo

Explanation: The escape sequence '\n' called new line 
takes the cursor to the beginning of the next line.Hence
with the first printf() "hello" and "hi" are printed on
consective lines.A '\r' on the other hand,takes the cursor
to the beginning of the same line in which the cursor is 
currently present.Hence,having printed "hello",the cursor
is sent back at 'hi' is printed.The first two letters of 
"hello" are therefore written over,and we get the output 
as "hillo".

5.  main()
    {  
    printf("%hello\b\b\b\b\b");
    printf("hi\b\b\bbye");
    }

Output:  byelo

Explanation:  The escape sequence '\b' stands for backspace
which takes the cursor to the previous character.In the
first printf(), "hello" is printed, following which the 
cursor is positioned after 'o'.Now the 5 backspaces take 
the cursor to the letter 'h' of "hello".The control now 
passes to the second printf(),and "hi" is written over the 
first three characters of "hello" resulting in "hilo".Once 
again 3 backspaces are encountered,which take the cursor 
back at 'h' of "hi".Next "bye" is printed on top of "hi".
The "lo" that is seen has persisted from the first printf()'s.
"hello", as it never got overwritten.Hence the output "byelo".

 6.main()
   {
     printf(" i\tam\ta\tboy");
   }

Output:i am a boy

Explanation:  The message is printed with space inserted 
wherever the escape sequence '\t' occured. This sequence 
stands for a tab.In one compiler,the tabs had been setup 
after every 5 colunms,at 0,5,10 etc.Hence while executing
printf(),when '\t' is encountered,the cursor skips to the 
immediately next column which is a multiple of 5,and then 
prints the next word.Thus 'i' is printed form the 15th 
column,"am" from the 5th,'a' from the 10th,and "boy" from
the 15th column.Some compilers like turbo c allow you to 
change the tab settings,so that the tab widths can set up 
as desired.

7. #include<stdio.h>
   main()
   {
    char str1[30],str2[30];
    printf("enter a sentence \n");
    scanf("%s",str1);
    printf("%s",str2);
    fflush(stdin);
    printf("\n enter a sentence \n");
    gets(str2);
    printf("%s",str2);
   }
Output:    enter a sentence
        nothing succeeds like success
           enter a sentence
        nothing succeeds like success
        nothing succeeds like success

Explanation: The scanf() suffers from the limitation that a 
maximum of only one word can be accepted by it.The moment a 
space(or a tab or a newline)is typed,scanf() assumes you have
finished supplying information ,and hence ignores whatever 
follows.That's why,str[] stroes only "Nothing,as it is proved 
by the first output.To overcome this limitation,we have an 
unformatted console i/o function called gets().It accepts 
whatever u type from the keyboard till the enter key is hit.
To be precise,get() accepts everything until a '\n' is 
encountered,which it replaces with a '\0' . 
   Thus the entire string that we entered is obtained in the
second output.fflush() flushes out the current keyboard buffer 
would be read by gets() .Since gets() is terminated on reading
an enter key ,u won't get a chance to supply the 2nd sentence.

8. #include
   main()
   {
    char name[20],name1[20];
    int age,age1;
    printf("enter name and age\n");
    scanf("%s%d",name,&age);
    printf("%s%d",name,age);
    printf("\n enter name and age\n");
    fscanf("stdin,"%s%d",name1,&age1);
    printf("stdout,"%s%d",name1,age1);
   }

Output: enter name and age
         raj 18
        enter name and age
         anjali 21

Explanation: Here the first set of statement comprising of 
prinf()s and scanf() is fairly simple.The fscanf() and 
fprintf() that follow next need some explaning.
      Fscanf( ) like scanf(),is used for formatted reading
of data. The only difference is that the former takes an
additional arugement that of a file pointer.This pointer 
indicates to the fscanf() from where the data is to be read.
whereas scanf() is capable of reading data onlyfrom the 
keyboard.In the call to fsacnf() the file pointer stdin is 
being used ,which sands for standard input device i.e the 
keyboard.Since stdin is a pointer to a standard file,we do 
not need to use fopen() to open it,as it is always open for 
reading.The counterpart of fscanf() is fprintf().

        It too needs a file pointer as its first argument.
Here the file pointer used is stdout,which stands for 
standard output device,i.e the display monitor.Thus using 
stdin in fscanf() and stdout in fprint() makes them them work
like the familiar scanf() and printf() functions.Hence both
the sets collect the  names and ages from keyboard.

<strong>OBJECTIVE TYPE QUESTIONS</strong>

What will be the output of the following programs:

1.main()
  {
               static char str[] ="Academy"
                    printf("%s\n%s",str,"Acemedy" );
     }
        a. Academy Academy              b.Error
        c.No Error                                d.None  

Output:    Academy Acamedy

Explanation:      We know that mentioning the name of a string yields the base address of the string.
            When this base address is passed to printf() it prints out each character in the string till it
 encounters '\0' sitting at the end of the string.A string written double quotes also gives the base address of the
 string.This base address when passed to printf() would result in printing "Acemedy"once again.


2.         main()
           {
                float  a=3.14;
                printf("%\na=%f",a);
                printf("%\na=%6.2f",a);
                printf("%\na=%-6.2f",a);
         printf("%\na=%6.1f",a);
                printf("%\na=%6.0f",a);
           }

Output:  a=3.140000
               a=  3.14
               a=3.14
               a=   3.1
               a=     3

Explanation:  The first printf() uses the format specification for a float,hence a gets printed as 3.140000,
 as bydefault a float is printed with 6 decimal places.In the next printf() the number that  precedes the f in %f is
 an optional specifier,which governs how exactly the varible is to be printed 6.2 signifies that the field width
 i.e the total number of columns that the values occupies on the screen,should be 6 and that the value should have 
 2 digits after the decimal point.Thus 3.14 is printed with blank spaces on the left,that is with right
 justification.
        For left justification,we use a minus sign with the specifiers,as is done in the next printf().It prints
 the value of a starting from the zeroth column,with only 2 decimal digits.The specification 6.1 prints 3.1 with
 right justification.
       In the last printf(),6.0 specifies zero decimal digits,have only 3 is dsplayed right justified.


3.           main()
            {
               printf("%20s\n","short leg"); 
              printf("%20s\na","long leg");
                printf("%20s\n","deep fine leg");
                printf("%20s\n","backward short leg");
                printf("%20s\n","legs all the same!");
               }

Output:                             shortleg
                                          longleg
                                  deep fine leg
                        backward short leg
                      legs all the same!

Explanation:  The output is right justified,as the field width specified with each %s is plus 20.For each string,
20 column are set aside,and the strings are printed with blanks filling up the remaining columns are on the left.


4. main()

         printf("hello\rhi");
   }

Output:      hello
               hi
               hillo

Explanation: The escape sequence '\n' called new line takes the cursor to the beginning of the next line.
 Hence with the first printf() "hello" and "hi" are printed on consective lines.A '\r' on the other hand,takes the

Explanation:       The escape sequence '\b' stands for backspace which takes the cursor to the previous character.
In the first printf(), "hello" is printed, following which the cursor is positioned after 'o'.
Now the 5 backspaces take the cursor to the letter 'h' of "hello".

Explanation:  The message is printed with space inserted wherever the escape sequence '\t' occured.
 This sequence stands for a tab.In one compiler,the tabs had been setup after every 5 colunms,at 0,5,10 etc.
 Hence while executing printf(),when '\t' is encountered,the cursor skips to the immediately next column which is a

 the 10th,and "boy" from the 15th column.Some compilers like turbo c allow you to change the tab settings,so that
 the tab widths can set up as desired.

                           gets(str2);
                     printf("%s",str2);
                }
Output:    enter a sentence
                  nothing succeeds like success
                  enter a sentence
                  nothing succeeds like success
