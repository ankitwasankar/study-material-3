                              <strong>DECISION MAKING AND BRANCHING </strong>

<strong><u>THE CASE CONTROL STRUCTURE(SWITCH) </u></strong> 
 
 
<strong><u>Introduction:</u></strong>In real life we are often faced with 
situations where we are required to make a choice between a number of 
alternatives rather than only one or two. Serious C programming is same, 
the choice  we are asked to make is more complicated than merely selecting 
between two alternatives. C provides a special control statement that allows
us to handle such cases effectively; rather than using a series of IF statements. 
  
<strong>Decisions Using Switch: </strong>
The control statement that allows us to make a decision from the numbers 
of choices is called a SWITCH, or more correctly a Switch-Case-Default, Since 
these 3 keywords go together to make up the control statement. 
 
They most often appear as Follows :     
<strong>switch</strong>(inter expression) 
{ 
         <strong>case</strong> constant 1: 
                              do this; 
         <strong>case</strong> constant 2: 
                              do this; 
         <strong>case</strong> constant 3: 
                              do this; 
         <strong>default:</strong> 
                              do this; 
} 


   The integer expression following the keyword SWITCH is any C expression that
will yield an integer constant like 1,2 or 3, or an expression that  evaluates to
an integer.
The keyword case is followed by an integer or a character constant.
<strong>Process of Execution:</strong>
When we run the program containing the switch, first the integer expression 
following the keyword switch is evaluated. The value it gives is then matched ,
one by one, against the constant values that follow the case statements. When
a match is found, the program executes the statements following that case, and 
all subsequent case and default statements. If no match is found with any of the 
case statements, default is executed.

<strong>Example:47</strong>
   
             main()
             {
                int i=1; 
                switch(i)
                {
                     case 1:
                               printf("I am in case1");

                     case 2:
                               printf("This is second one");
                     case 3:
                               printf("This is third case");
                     default :
                               printf("your are in default");
                }
           }
OUTPUT:
             The output of this program would be:
                                                       
                                     I am in case1
                                    This is second one
                                    This is third case
                                    your are in default
The output is definitely not what we expected. We didn't expect 2nd,
3rd and default cases print output.
If you want only case 2 should get executed, it is up to you to get out of 
the switch then and there by using a Break statement. Note that there is no
need for a break statement after the default, since the control comes out of 
the switch anyway.

<strong>Example:48</strong>
               
          main()
          {
               int i=2;
               switch(i)
               {
                     case 1:
                                 printf("I am in case1");
                                 break;
                     case 2:
                                 printf("This is second one");
                                 break;
                     case 3:
                                 printf("This is third case");
                                 break;
                     default :
                                 printf("your are in default");
               }                                          
          }
OUTPUT:       This is second one


<strong>Example:53</strong>
                      
            main()
            {
                  char suite=3;
                  switch(suite)
                  {
                      case 1:
                                 printf("\n Diamond");
                      case 2:
                                 printf("\n Spade");
                      default:
                                 printf("\n Heart");
                  }
                  printf("\n I thought one wears a suite");
            }
 
OUTPUT:                                                    
                                   Heart
                               I thought one wears a suite

<strong>Example:54</strong>
                     
            main()
            {
                  int c=3;
                  switch(c)
                  {
                        case 'v' :
                                     printf("This is v case");
                                     break;
                        case 3:
                                     printf(" Iam in a Third case");
                                     break;
                        case 12:
                                     printf("This is 12 th case");
                                     break;
                        default:
                                     printf("Default case?");
                                     break;
                   }
              }
OUTPUT:
                                Iam in a Third case.
 
                 
<strong>Example:55</strong>
                     
            main()            
            {
                 int k,j=2;
                 switch(k=j+1)
                 {
                     case 0: 
                                printf("\n Hai");
                     case 1:
                                printf("\n Hello");
                     case 2:
                                printf("\n Hai 1");
                     default:
                                printf("\n Bye");
                 }
           }

OUTPUT:
                 Bye
               
<strong>Example:56</strong>
                  
          main()
          {
               int i=0;
               switch(i)
               {
                    case 0:        printf("\n Customers are dicey");

                    case 1:        printf("\n Markets are priery");
                                      
                    case 2:        printf("\n Investors are moody");
                                        
                    case 3:        printf("\n Employees are lazy");
                }
         }

OUTPUT:
                                       Customers are dicey
                                       Markets are priery
                                       Investors are moody
                                       Employees are lazy

Explanation:         Here case is not having break that's why all the
statements preceded by required cases are also executed.

<strong>Example:57</strong>
                     
              main()
              {
                 int k;
                 float j=2.0;
                 switch(k=j+1)
                 {
                     case 3:
                                 printf("\n Trapped");  
                                 break;
                     default:
                                 printf("\n Caught!");
                  }
                                   
             }

OUTPUT:  
                   Caught!

<strong>Example:58</strong>
                    
             main()
             {
                  int i=4;
                  switch(i)
                  {           
                       default:
                                   printf("\n A mouse is an Alphabet built by Japaneese");
                                                        
                       case 1:
                                   printf("\n Breeding rabbits is a raising experience");
                                   break;
                       case 2:
                                   printf("Friction is a drag");
                                   break;
                       case 3:
                                  printf("\n If pratice makes perfect, then noboby's perfect");    
                  }
            }

OUTPUT:
                     A mouse is an Alphabet built by Japanese
                     Breeding rabbits is a raising experience

<strong>Example:59</strong>
               
             main()
             {
                  int i=4,j=2;
                  switch(i)
                  {
                        case 1:
                                  printf("\n To err is human,to forgive is 
				  against company policy");
                                  break;
                        case j:
                                  printf("\n If you have nothing to do, don't do it here");
                                  break;
                  }
             }

OUTPUT:         constant expression required in the second case, we can not use j.
 .                 
<strong>Example:60</strong>

.
         main()                                      
         {
              int i=1;
              switch(i)
              {
                  case 1:
                           printf("\n Radio Active cats have 18 half-lives");
                           break;
                  case 1*2+4:
                           printf("Bottle for rent-inquire within");
                           break;
               }
         }  

OUTPUT:      Radio Active cats have 18 half-lives

Explanation:     No error in this program. Constant expression like 
1*2+4 are acceptable in cases of a switch.
<strong>Example:61</strong>            
       main() 
       {
           int a =10;
           switch(a)
           {
           }
           printf("\n Programmers   never die, They just get lost in the  processing");                                    
       }

Explanation:
             Though never required, there can exist a switch which has no cases.

OUTPUT:
           Programmers   never die, They just get lost in the   processing


<strong>Example:62</strong>
          main()
           {
                 int i=1;
                 switch(i)
                 {
                      printf("hello");
                      case 1:
                                printf(" \n Individualists unite!");

                                break;
                      case 2:
                                printf("\n Money is the root of all wealth");l
                                break;
                 }
            }

Explanation:
        Though   there is no error, irrespective of the value of   i  the first
printf() can never    get executed . In other words, all statements in a switch 
have to belong to same case or the other.
